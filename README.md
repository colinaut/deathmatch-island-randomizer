# Deathmatch Island Production Arbitrator

A simple randomizer for the table top roleplaying game (Deathmatch Island)[https://www.deathmatchis.land/] by (Old Dog Games)[http://olddog.games/]. I got permission from the author of the game to use all the random tables in the book. This is especially useful for making character creation fast.

The randomizer is hosted at (https://deathmatch.mirthpeddlers.com)[https://deathmatch.mirthpeddlers.com/].

## Tech

This is a simple Svelte 5 based responsive web app with all the tables as json files.

## License

The code is MIT licensed. Content, especially the random tables, are copyright Old Dog Games.
